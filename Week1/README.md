# Second Hour
-
- Command Line Basics
  - why are we talking about the command line?
  - We fear what we do not know!
    - Do not fear the command line
    - Let's learn it instead
  - opening the command line
  - basic commands [commandLineBasics.md](commandLineBasics.md)
  - installing Gow or Running Gitbash
  - why BASH and not MS DOS?
  - BASH is a richer utilitie or set of utilities... BASH works on Mac and Linux
- Most common commands
  - ls, ls -al
    - lists all your files and directories
  - cd
    - change directory
  - mkdir [foldername]
    - creates a directory (aka a folder)
  - rm [filename]
  - rm -r [foldername]
  - rm -rf [foldername]
  - BE EXTRA CAREFUL WITH RM
  - touch [filename]
  - cat [filename]
  - mv [filename] [newfilename]
  - use of tab
    - e.g. cd /users/Java[tab] will finish out the command
  - use of up and down arrows
  - history
  - cd .. to go up one directory
    - .. means up one
    - . means the current directory
  - history > myhistory.txt
  - ./[exectuable file name]
  - clear
- Most common git commands
  - git itself is a command
  - we study these once we install git  

# Third hour - Installing Software


## Install Visual Studio Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/

- https://code.visualstudio.com/

## Install the plugin JSHint in Visual Studio

## Install git for your appropriate OS (Linux, Mac or Windows) from https://git-scm.com/downloads
- Documentation at https://git-scm.com/doc
- Setup your credentials locally using these instructions https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/configure-your-dvcs-username-for-commits-950301867.html

## Let's examine git
 - git clone
 - git remote -v
 - git status
 - git add .
 - git commit -m "I changed something"
 - git push origin master

 - the three step process
 - change or add files
 - git add to stage files
 - git status to see staged files
 - git commit to commit changes locally
 - git push to commit changes to remote branch
 - branches
 - git branch
 - creating a branch
 - git checkout -b feature/add-login
 - git checkout master
 - git checkout feature/add-login
 - the .gitignore file

# Installing required software

## Install node from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

## Create a github account and email me the link to your repo so I can follow you at BeginningProgrammer.com@gmail.com

- https://github.com/

## Fork this repository and then clone it from your repository
- https://github.com/fernandozamoraj/JavaScriptForNewProgrammersCourse


## Keep your fork up to date by adding an upstream
- Instructions are here on how to do that https://stefanbauer.me/articles/how-to-keep-your-git-fork-up-to-date 

## Run the [helloWorld.js](helloWorld.js) program in Week1 folder
- node hellowWorld.js
