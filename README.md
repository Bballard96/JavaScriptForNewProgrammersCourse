# JavaScript for New Programmers

This is a course designed for total new programmers that know nothing or next to nothing about JavaScript.

This program is designed by me, Fernando Zamora, and it is intended to be taught primarily in a virtual teleconference environment like zoom or skype.  It could potentially be taught in a classroom, but it's primary design is for teaching in online.

This course will be taught by Fernando Zamora.
Fernando Zamora is a software engineer with 20 years experience.  He holds
a B.S. in Computer Science from Tarleton State University and a Masters of Science from Texas A&M University Central Texas.  Fernando also has over 800
hours tutoring experience in many programming languages to include JavaScript, Python, C#, C and C++, as well as many hours teaching experience in topics related to software development.
